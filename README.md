# Advent of code solutions

I participated in the advent of code 2020 and wanted to share my solutions. I will not include inputs, because it's different for everyone. To use this, get your input and save it as `input.txt` in the \[year\]/\[day\] diectory, then run `python ape.py` in the directory for the solution. In the future I plan to add some other files too, like `vis.py` that use visuals to show what it's doing.

I test tested all this on Arch Linux with python 3.9.0. It should work on windows and MacOS, it also has no dependecies.

**NOTE:** this is in no way the best way of doing this and most of this code is spegetti, so I hope you hungry.
