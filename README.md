# Advent of code solutions

I participated in the advent of code 2020 and wanted to share my solutions. I will not include inputs, because it's different for everyone. To use this, get your input and save it as `input.txt` in the \[year\]/\[day\] diectory, then run one of the python scripts in a perminal from that directory. `ape.py` will just straight up give you the answer (this should work everywhere with python3). `vis.py` will have some (bad) visuals too, this should work on all unix systems or wtih any terminal that supports ansi escape codes.

I test tested all this on Arch Linux with python 3.9.0. It should work on windows and MacOS, it also has no dependecies.

**NOTE:** this is in no way the best way of doing this and most of this code is spegetti, so I hope you hungry.
